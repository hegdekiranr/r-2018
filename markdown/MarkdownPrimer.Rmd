# My First Section

We started a new section with a hashtag and this is the first paragraph in that section. Spacing is important in markdown, so be aware of that. Adding a third sentence so that I have a full paragraph to meet antiquated rules of grammar which might not apply anymore. And I'll start a sentence with and. J.D. Salinger rules!!!!

Leaving a blank line before the next text starts a new paragraph.

# New Section

You start a new section simply by creating a new one with a hashtag. There is no need to close the old section.

# Subsections

Creating subsections is just as easy, we simply use two hashtags.

## First Subsection

We started a subsection, within a section with two hashtags and didn't need to do anything to the outer section.

## Another Subsection

Making a second subsection is just like making the first subsection, just use two hashtags. Again, no need to close the prior subsection.

# Back to Sections

Repeating the point, you start a new section, even after subsections, simply by creating a new one with a single hashtag. No closing anything.

# Formatting Text

_Emphasized Text_

__Strong Text__

___Emphasized and Bold Text___

`anything in backticks looks like computer code, or typewriter text`

# R Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
x <- 3
x
```

```{r}
x*2
```

Let's give our chunks names.

```{r simple-code-ex}
x*3 + 7
```

Let's show the results of a chunk without seeing the code.

```{r another-example,echo=FALSE}
5*x + 4
```

# Plots

Let's make a nice plot.

```{r load-ggplot}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r plot-diamonds,fig.align='center',fig.cap='A scatterplot of diamond price vs size, color coded according to diamond cut.',cache=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + 
    geom_point()
```
